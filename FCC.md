Functions, Parameters, Arguments, and `arguments`:
```
function interpolate(param1, param2){
   return param1 + ' ' + param2 + ' ' + arguments[2]
}
interpolate('tic', 'tac', 'toe') // 'tic tac toe'
```


Almost useless:
```
function print(str){
    console.log(str)
}
```
More useful:
```
function interpolate(param1, param2){
   return param1 + ' ' + param2 + ' ' + arguments[2]
}
interpolate('tic', 'tac', 'toe') // 'tic tac toe'
```

Even better using ES6/Template Literals:
```
const interpolate = (param1, param2, ...rest) => `${param1}, ${param2}, ${rest}`
interpolate('run', 'run', 'as fast as you can!') // 'run, run, as fast as you can!'
```

 > ### Quality Standards
 > In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, Quality is key), we have provided examples of the quality standards we encourage. This applies mainly to beginners.
 > 
 > * PRs that are automated e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove white space / optimize images.
 > * PRs that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR.
 > * PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
 > * Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October.
