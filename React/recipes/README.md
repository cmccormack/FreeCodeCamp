## Build a Recipe Box

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVXWag/).

Fulfill the below user stories:
* User Story: I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
* User Story: I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
* User Story: I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
* User Story: I can edit these recipes.
* User Story: I can delete these recipes.
* User Story: All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
* Hint: You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. _username_recipes
