## Build a Markdown Previewer

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/).

Fulfill the below user stories:
* User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
* User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
* Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked
* Note: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor
