        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective  approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>Before looking into potential opportunities related to — and the key programmatic differences between — Python 2 and Python 3, let’s take a look into the background of the more recent major releases of Python.</p>
        <span class="subheading">Python 2</span>
        <p>Published in late 2000, Python 2 signalled a more transparent and inclusive language development process than earlier versions of Python with the implementation of PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal), a technical specification that either provides information to Python community members or describes a new feature of the language.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Python 2 included many more programmatic features including a cycle-detecting garbage collector to automate memory management, increased Unicode support to standardize characters, and list comprehensions to create a list based on existing lists. As Python 2 continued to develop, more features were added, including unifying Python’s types and classes into one hierarchy in Python version 2.2.</p>
        <span class="subheading">Python 3</span>
        <p>Python 3 is regarded as the future of Python and is the version of the language that is currently in development. A major overhaul, Python 3 was released in late 2008 to address and amend intrinsic design flaws of previous versions of the language. The focus of Python 3 development was to clean up the codebase and remove redundancy, making it clear that there was only one way to perform a given task.</p>
        <p>Major modifications to Python 3.0 included changing the print statement into a built-in function, improve the way integers are divided, and providing more Unicode support.</p>
        <p>At first, Python 3 was slowly adopted due to the language not being backwards compatible with Python 2, requiring people to make a decision as to which version of the language to use. Additionally, many package libraries were only available for Python 2, but as the development team behind Python 3 has reiterated that there is an end of life for Python 2 support, more libraries have been ported to Python 3. The increased adoption of Python 3 can be shown by the number of Python packages that now provide Python 3 support, which at the time of writing includes 339 of the 360 most popular Python packages.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
      <header class="section-header">Hello World</header>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>To get started with writing Python, open IDLE and write your first "Hello world" Python code: </p>
    <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello, World!")
    Hello, World!</code>
      </div>

      <div class="section-body">
        <span class="subheading">Python Indentations</span>
        <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important.</p>
        <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code:</p>
        <code>>>> if "a" in "apple":
...   print("a is in apple!")
...
a is in apple!
>>> if "a" in "apple":
... print("a is in apple!")
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    print("a is in apple!")
        ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block</code>
        <span class="subheading">Comments</span>
        <p>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.</p>
        <p>Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment: </p>
        <code>#this is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!</code>
        <span class="subheading">Docstrings</span>
        <p>Python also has extended documentation capability, called docstrings.</p>
        <p>Docstrings can be one line, or multiline.</p>
        <p>Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring:</p>
        <code>"""This is a
multiline docstring."""
print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!</code>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header class="section-header">Variables</header>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.<p>
        <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
<code>>>> fruit = "banana"
>>> name = "Chris"
>>> print(name + " likes " + fruit + "s!")
Chris likes bananas!</code>
        <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
<code>>>> notype = 4
>>> print(notype)
4
>>> notype = "monkey"
>>> print(notype)
monkey</code>

        <header class="section-header">Variable Naming</header>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
          <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
          <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
          <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
        </ul>
      
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Types">
      <header class="section-header">Variable Types</header>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>Python has five standard Data Types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Numbers</li>
          <li>Strings</li>
          <li>List</li>
          <li>Tuple</li>
          <li>Dictionary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Python sets the variable type based on the value that is assigned to it.</p>
        <span class="subheading">Numbers</span>
        <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Integer</li>
          <li>Float</li>
          <li>Complex</li>
        </ul>
        <code>x = 42    # int
y = 4.2   # float
z = 42j   # complex</code>
        <span class="subheading">Strings</span>
        <p>String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.:</p>
        <mark>'banana'</mark> is the same as <mark>"banana"</mark>
        <p>Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.</p>
        <code>>>> fruit = "banana"
>>> fruit[0]
'b'
>>> fruit[2:]
'nana'</code>
        <span class="subheading">List</span>
        <p>A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Lists allow duplicate members.  Lists are written with square brackets.</p>
        <code>>>> fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
>>> print(fruits)
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
>>> fruits.append("peach")
>>> print(fruits)
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'peach']
>>> fruits.remove("cherry")
>>> print(fruits)
['apple', 'banana', 'peach']
        </code>
        <span class="subheading">Tuple</span>
        <p>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with parenthesis.</p>
        <code>>>> mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
>>> print(mytuple)
('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
>>> mytuple[0] = "egg"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> print(mytuple)
('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
        </code>
        <span class="subheading">Dictionary</span>
        <p>A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.</p>
        <code>>>> myfruitdict = { "apple": "red", "banana": "yellow", "orange": "orange" }
>>> print(myfruitdict)
{'orange': 'orange', 'banana': 'yellow', 'apple': 'red'}
>>> print(myfruitdict["orange"])
orange
>>> del(myfruitdict["apple"])
>>> print(myfruitdict)
{'orange': 'orange', 'banana': 'yellow'}
>>> myfruitdict["peach"] = "peach"
>>> print(myfruitdict)
{'orange': 'orange', 'peach': 'peach', 'banana': 'yellow'}
        </code>
