## Build a Camper Leaderboard

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/).

Fulfill the below user stories:
* User Story: I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
* User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
* User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
